# Introduction

Browsertrix Cloud is designed to be a cloud-native application running in Kubernetes.

However, despite the name, it is perfectly reasonable (and easy!) to deploy Browsertrix Cloud locally using one of the many available local Kubernetes options. Here are a few recommendations for different scenarios.

The main requirements for Browsertrix Cloud are:

- A Kubernetes Cluster
- Helm (package manager for Kubernetes)

We have prepared a [Local Deployment](./local) and [Production (Self-Hosted and Cloud) Deployment](./production) guides to help with
setting up Browsertrix Cloud for different scenarios.
