# Production: Self-Hosted and Cloud

For production and hosted deployments (both on a single machine or in the cloud), the only requirement is to have a designed domain
and (strongly recommended, but not required) second domain for signing web archives. 

We are also experimenting with Ansible playbooks for cloud deployment setups.

The production deployments also allow using an external mongodb server, and/or external S3-compatible storage instead of the bundled minio.


## Single Machine Deployment with MicroK8S

For a single-machine production deployment, we recommend using microk8s.

1. Install MicroK8S, as suggested in [the local deployment guide](./local) and ensure the `ingress` and `cert-manager` addons are also enabled.

2. Set the `ingress.host`, `ingress.cert_email` and `signing.host` fields in `./examples/microk8s-hosted.yaml` to your host and domain

3. Set the supeadmin username and password, and mongodb username and password, also in `./examples/microk8s-hosted.yaml`

4. Run with `helm upgrade --install -f ./chart/values.yaml -f ./chart/microk8s-hosted.yaml btrix ./chart/`


### Using Custom Storage

If you would like to use existing external storage, such an existing S3-compatible storage, also set the default storage, for example:

```
minio_local: false

storages:
  - name: "default"
    access_key: <access key>
    secret_key: <secret key>

    endpoint_url: "https://s3.<region>.amazonaws.com/bucket/path/"
```

Note that this setup is not limited to Amazon S3, but should work with any S3-compatible storage service.


### Using Custom MongoDB

If you would like to use an externally hosted MongoDB, you can add the following config to point to a custom MongoDB instance.

The `db_url` should follow the [MongoDB Connection String Format](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/connection-string/)
which should include the username and password of the remote instance.


```
mongo_local: false

mongo_auth:
  db_url: mongodb+srv://...


## Cloud Deployment

There are also many ways to deploy Browsertrix Cloud on various cloud providers.

To simplify this process, we are working on Ansible playbooks for setting up Browsertrix Cloud on commonly used infrastructure.

Thus, far we have the following Ansible playbooks available:
