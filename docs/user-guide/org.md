# Introduction to orgs

A Browsertrix org, or organization, is your workspace for web archiving. If you’re archiving collaboratively, an org workspace can be shared between team members.

Every Browsertrix user belongs to one or more orgs. You'll create an org during sign up if you sign up for Browsertrix through one of our hosted plans.

Billing is managed per-org. Depending on your plan, your org may have monthly quotas for storage and minutes of crawl time. These quotas can be increased by upgrading your plan.

You can change or your name, URL, default workflow settings, and more from the [**Settings**](./org-settings.md) page.
