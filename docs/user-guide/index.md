# Browsertrix User Guide

Welcome to the Browsertrix user guide! While our aim with our software is to create interfaces so intuitive no additional explination is needed, sometimes the complexities of web archiving require a little more expansion. If there's something that you found especially confusing or frustrating and — after searching for it here — no satisfactory answer was given, we'd like to know about it, [please get in touch](docs-feedback@webrecorder.net)!

## Getting Started

A [Crawl Workflow](crawl-workflows) must be created in order to crawl websites automatically. A detailed list of all available workflow configuration options can be found on the [Crawl Workflow Setup](workflow-setup) page.

Once you've created your first Crawl Workflow, here's a few more topics you may want to delve into:

- Adding [exclusions](workflow-setup/#exclusions) to limit your crawl's scope and evading crawler traps by [editing exclusion rules while crawling](crawl-workflows/#live-exclusion-editing).
- Best practices for crawling with [browser profiles](browser-profiles) to capture content only available when logged in to a website.
- Organizing and combining archived items with [Collections](collections) for sharing and export.
- If you're an admin: [Inviting collaborators to your org](org-settings/#members).
