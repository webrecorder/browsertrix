# Register For an Account

!!! note "Self-hosting?"

    This guide only applies to hosted Browsertrix accounts. If you're self-hosting Browsertrix, [enable open registration](../deploy/customization.md#enable-open-registration) to allow others to sign up for an account on your instance.

To sign up for Browsertrix, [choose a plan](https://browsertrix.com/). We offer a variety of plans for individuals, teams, and organizations of all sizes.

## Register Your Org

After you finish setting up your subscription, you'll receive an email from us with a link to set up your org (organization.)

Choose an org name that's unique and memorable, like the name of your company or organization. Your org URL identifier will determine the unique URL of the org's home page.

## Configure Your User Account

Create a password and display name. Your display name is the name that is visible to other org members. For example, your display name will be visible in crawl workflows that you create or run.

Once you've completed this step, you're in! Next, familiarize yourself with the [org overview](./overview.md), head over to [crawl workflows](./crawl-workflows.md), or [invite team members](./org-settings.md).

## Can't complete sign-up or have a question?

Don't hesitate to [reach out to us](mailto:support@webrecorder.org) if you encounter any issues while signing up.
