# Your First Crawl

Letâ€™s crawl your first webpage! Start by opening up a webpage that you'd like to crawl, and note the URL for later.

## Logging in

To start crawling with hosted Browsertrix, you'll need a Browsertrix account. [Sign up for an account](./signup.md) and log in.

!!! note "Self-hosting"

    If you'd like to try Browsertrix before signing up, or you have specialized hosting requirements, you can host Browsertrix yourself. [Set up Browsertrix](../deploy/index.md) on your system and log in as your admin user.

## Starting the crawl

Once you've logged in you should see your org [overview](overview.md). If you land somewhere else, navigate to **Overview**.

1. Tap the _Create New..._ shortcut and select **Crawl Workflow**.
2. Choose **Known URLs**. We'll get into the details of the options [later](./crawl-workflows.md), but this is a good starting point for a simple crawl.
3. Enter the URL of the webpage that you noted earlier in **Crawl URL(s)**.
4. Tap _Review & Save_.
5. Tap _Save Workflow_.
6. You should now see your new crawl workflow. Give the crawler a few moments to warm up, and then watch as it archives the webpage!
