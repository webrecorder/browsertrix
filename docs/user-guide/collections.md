# Collections

Collections are the primary way of organizing and combining archived items into groups for presentation.

!!! tip "Tip — Combining items from multiple sources"
    If the crawler has not captured every resource or interaction on a webpage, the [ArchiveWebpage browser extension](https://archiveweb.page/) can be used to manually capture missing content and upload it directly to your org.

    After adding the crawl and the upload to a collection, the content from both will become available in the replay viewer.

## Adding Content to Collections

Crawls and uploads can be added to a collection as part of the initial creation process or after creation by selecting _Edit Collection_ from the collection's actions menu.

A crawl workflow can also be set to [automatically add any completed archived items to a collection](../workflow-setup/#collection-auto-add) in the workflow's settings.

## Sharing Collections

Collections are private by default, but can be made public by marking them as sharable in the Metadata step of collection creation, or by toggling the _Collection is Shareable_ switch in the share collection dialogue.

After a collection has been made public, it can be shared with others using the public URL available in the share collection dialogue. The collection can also be embedded into other websites using the provided embed code. Unsharing the collection will break any previously shared links.

For further resources on embedding archived web content into your own website, see the [ReplayWebpage docs page on embedding](https://replayweb.page/docs/embedding).
