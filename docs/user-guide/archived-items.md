# Archived Items

Archived Items consist of one or more WACZ files created by a Crawl Workflow, or uploaded to Browsertrix. They can be individually replayed, or combined with other archived items in a [collection](collections.md).  The archived items page lists all items in the organization.

## Uploading Web Archives

WACZ files can be given metadata and uploaded to Browsertrix by pressing the _Upload WACZ_ button on the archived items list page. Only one WACZ file can be uploaded at a time.

## Archived Item Details

The Archived Item details page is composed of five sections, though the crawl settings tab is only available for crawls and not uploads.

### Overview

The Overview tab displays the item's metadata and statistics associated with its creation process.

Metadata can be edited by pressing the pencil icon at the top right of the metadata section to edit the item's description, tags, and collections it is associated with.

### Replay

The Replay tab displays the web content contained within the archived item.
