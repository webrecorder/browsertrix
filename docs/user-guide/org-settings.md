# Change Org Settings

Settings that apply to the entire organization are found in the **Settings** page. If you're an org admin, you'll see the link to _Settings_ in the org navigation bar.

## General

Change your organization's name and URL identifier in this tab. Choose an org name that's unique and memorable, like the name of your company or organization. Org name and URLs are unique to each Browsertrix instance (for example, on browsertrix.com) and you may be asked to change the org name or URL identifier if either are already in use by another org.

## Billing

`Paid Feature`{ .badge-green }

View and manage your org's current payment plan and associated quotas. Usage history statistics for previous months are shown here to better inform your plan and quota requirements.

<!-- ## Crawl Workflows

Set default suggested settings for all new crawl workflows in this tab. When creating a new workflow, org members will see the form pre-filled with default values. Org members can still change or remove these settings when configuring the workflow. Removing a default setting will revert the setting back to Browsertrix defaults. -->

<!-- ## Limits

This tab lets organization admins set an additional number of allowed overage minutes when the organization's monthly execution minutes quota has been reached. If set, this serves as a hard cap after which all running crawls will be stopped. When set at the default of 0, crawls will be stopped as soon as the monthly quota is reached. -->
