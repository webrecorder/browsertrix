# Developer Docs

Browsertrix Cloud consists of a Python-based backend and TypeScript-based frontend.

### Backend

The backend is an API-only system, using the FastAPI framework. The latest API reference is available
under ./api of a running cluster.

*TODO Add additional info here*

### Frontend

The frontend UI is implemented in TypeScript, using the Lit framework and Shoelace component library.

The static build of the frontend is bundled with nginx, but the frontend can be deployed locally in dev mode against an existing backend.

See [Running Frontend](./frontend-dev) for more details.
