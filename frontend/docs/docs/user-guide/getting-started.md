# Your First Crawl

Let’s crawl your first webpage! Start by opening up a webpage that you'd like to crawl, and note the URL for later.

## Accessing your dashboard

To start a crawl, you'll need to log in using a Browsertrix account that has [**crawler** permissions](./org-members.md#permission-levels).

You likely have crawler permissions already if:

- You [registered for an org on hosted Browsertrix](./signup.md)
- You [joined an existing org](./join.md) and were given crawler permissions
- You are the admin of a self-hosted instance

Check if you have crawler permissions by logging in. If you see a _+ Create New..._ button near the org name, you're able to start a crawl. If you don't see this button and think that you should, contact your org admin to update your permissions.

## Starting the crawl

When you log in, the first page you see is the [org dashboard](overview.md). If you've navigated away to another page, navigate back to **Dashboard**.

1. Tap the _Create New..._ shortcut and select **Crawl Workflow**.
2. Enter the URL of the webpage that you noted earlier as the **URL to Crawl**.
3. Tap _Run Crawl_.
4. You should now see your new crawl workflow running. Give the crawler a few moments to warm up, and then watch as it archives the webpage!
