# Public Collections Gallery

Collections provide a way to dynamically combine and group multiple individual crawls and uploads into a contextual, unified archive replay experience.

With Public Collections Gallery, you can create a dedicated page that showcases all public Collections in one place, allowing you to personalize, curate, and share your web archives with the world!

### Customizing the Gallery

The Public Collection Gallery page will automatically have the title of your Org. You can customize this page by including a **Description** and your org's **Website** by adding them from your org's **Settings** of your account. The Gallery URL is always based on the Org URL, if you change one, the other changes as well.

For example, if your org URL ends with `/my-org`, than the Public Collections Gallery will be made available at `/explore/my-org`.

3. In that Collection's **Sharing** tab, change its visibility from the default **Private** to **Public** and save

4. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 as needed to share all the Collections you want

5. When you're done, click the globe icon :bootstrap-globe2: in order to see all your public Collections

### Customize Collections

The [Presentation and Sharing](../presentation-sharing) page provides further details for options on how to present and share Collections in your Public Collections Gallery. Your Public Collection Gallery page will automatically have the title of your org. You can customize this page by including a **Description** and your org's **Website** by adding them from your org's **Settings** of your account.

### Description

A **Description** about your Collection is not required, but it is useful information to share additional context and details of your collection with your org team members or the public by writing a description.

You can edit the **Description** as long as its within 150 characters, which is roughly between 90 words and 150 words with spaces included in the character count. The **Description** supports basic text formatting like headings, bold and italicized text, lists, and links.

### Website

Link to your org's (or your personal) website so viewers can visit from your Public Collections Gallery page.

how your Collection appears to the public by clicking the edit button :bootstrap-pencil: in each collection to:

- **Name** it and add a **description** — include emojis if that’s your style 😉

- Select a **thumbnail** to represent it: Choose between a page screenshot and a placeholder

- Choose the **initial view** for your collection.
