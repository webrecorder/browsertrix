# Intro to Public Collections Gallery

Collections provide a way to dynamically combine and group multiple individual crawls and uploads into a contextual, unified archive replay experience.

With Public Collections Gallery, you can create a dedicated page that showcases all public Collections in one place, allowing you to personalize, curate, and share your web archives with the world!

## Enable Public Collections Gallery

You can take the following steps to enable the Public Collections Gallery for your organization. Note: This feature is available in Browsertrix 1.14 and later.

1. Log in to your Browsertrix account

2. In your org's **settings**, click **enable public collections gallery** and save

3. Back on your **dashboard**, you should see the **Public Collections** section.

## Make It Your Own

When Public Collections Gallery is live, you can customize and curate how your public Collections appear directly in your dashboard, and even personalize your Public Collections Gallery URL within your org's **settings**. The [Presentation and Sharing](../presentation-sharing) page provides further details for options on sharing collections.
