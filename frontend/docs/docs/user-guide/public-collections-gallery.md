# Intro to Public Collections Gallery

Collections provide a way to dynamically combine and group multiple individual crawls and uploads into a contextual, unified archive replay experience.

With Public Collections Gallery, you can create a dedicated page that showcases all public Collections in one place, allowing you to personalize, curate, and share your web archives with the world!

## Enable Public Collections Gallery

Public Collections Gallery will not be visible unless your org has enabled. You can [enable your org's Public Collections Gallery](../presentation-sharing#sharing-public-collection-gallery) from your account's settings. Note: This feature is available in Browsertrix 1.14 and later.

## Make It Your Own

When Public Collections Gallery is live, you can customize and curate how your public Collections appear directly in your dashboard, and even personalize your Public Collections Gallery URL within your org's **settings**. The [Presentation and Sharing](../presentation-sharing) page provides further details for options on sharing collections.

### Add Collections

If you don‚Äôt have any public Collections yet, on the right side of the section you'll see three different icons.

1. Click the asterisk icon :bootstrap-asterisk: in order to see all your Collections.

2. Click the edit button :bootstrap-pencil: on the specific Collection you want to share

3. In that Collection's **Sharing** tab, change its visibility from the default **Private** to **Public** and save

4. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 as needed to share all the Collections you want

5. When you're done, click the globe icon :bootstrap-globe2: in order to see all your public Collections
