# Public Collections Gallery

Collections provide a way to dynamically combine and group multiple individual crawls and uploads into a contextual, unified archive replay experience.

With Public Collections Gallery, you can create a dedicated page that showcases all public Collections in one place, allowing you to personalize, curate, and share your web archives with the world!

## Enable Public Collections Gallery

The _enable public collections gallery_ toggle is located in the org's **Settings** tab within your account. Follow these steps to activate the Public Collections Gallery.

1. Log in to your Browsertrix account

2. In your org's **settings**, click **enable public collections gallery** and save

3. You can share the link to your Public Collections Page from either copying from the org's **settings**, or by clicking on the copy button next to "**Visit public collections gallery**" from your dashboard.

Note: If you choose to hide the gallery later, you can go back to the setting and set the toggle to off at any time.
The gallery will still be available for logged in users to preview, but the public page will be hidden.
Public Collections will be treated the same as *Unlisted* when the public gallery is turned off.

### Customizing the Gallery

The Public Collection Gallery page will automatically have the title of your Org. You can customize this page by including a **Description** and your org's **Website** by adding them from your org's **Settings** of your account. The Gallery URL is always based on the Org URL, if you change one, the other changes as well.

For example, if your org URL ends with `/my-org`, than the Public Collections Gallery will be made available at `/explore/my-org`.
