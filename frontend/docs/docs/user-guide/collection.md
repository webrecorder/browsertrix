# Intro to Collections

## Create a Collection

You can create a collection from the Collections page, or the  _Create New ..._ shortcut from the org overview.

### Adding Collection Content

Collections are the primary way of organizing and combining archived items into groups for presentation. Collections also allow you to view a combined replay of any archived items they contain; if a link is present when viewing a collection but the actual page is missing, and another item with that captured page is added to the collection, the link will now work as expected.

!!! tip "Tip: Patching a crawl with interactive archiving"
    If the crawler has not captured every resource or interaction on a webpage, our [ArchiveWeb.page browser extension](https://webrecorder.net/archivewebpage) can be used to interactively capture missing content using your web browser and upload it directly to your org.

    After adding crawls and uploads to a collection, content from both will become available in the replay viewer.

Crawls and uploads can be added to a collection after creation by selecting _Select Archived Items_ from the collection's actions menu.

A crawl workflow can also be set to [automatically add any completed crawls to a collection](workflow-setup.md#collection-auto-add) in the workflow's settings.

## Downloading Collections

Downloading a collection will export every archived item in it as a single WACZ file. To download a collection, use the _Download Collection_ option under the collection's _Actions_ dropdown.

## Browsing and Sharing Collections

Collections can be accessed by anyone within the organization and can also be shared with others externally.

The next page covers the steps needed to create a [public collection gallery](../public-collections-gallery).
