# Intro to Collections

A collection is a specific, user-directed grouping of archived items from either crawls or WACZ files. You can create a collection, add content to your collection, include a description to your collection, download your collection, and share your collection whichever way you need to others in your community.

## Create a Collection

You can create a collection from the Collections page directly, or the  _Create New..._ shortcut from the org dashboard.

### Add Collection Content

Collections are the primary way of organizing and combining archived items into groups for presentation. Collections also allow you to view a combined replay of any archived items they contain; if a link is present when viewing a collection but the actual page is missing, and another item with that captured page is added to the collection, the link will now work as expected.

!!! tip "Tip: Patching a crawl with interactive archiving"
    If the crawler has not captured every resource or interaction on a webpage, our [ArchiveWeb.page browser extension](https://webrecorder.net/archivewebpage) can be used to interactively capture missing content using your web browser and upload it directly to your org.

    After adding crawls and uploads to a collection, content from both will become available in the replay viewer.

Crawls and uploads can be added to a collection after creation by selecting _Select Archived Items_ from the collection's actions menu.

A crawl workflow can also be set to [automatically add any completed crawls to a collection](workflow-setup.md#collection-auto-add) in the workflow's settings.

### Customize a Collection

The [Presentation and Sharing](../presentation-sharing) page provides further details for options on how to present and share Collections. You can customize how your Collection appears to the public by clicking the edit button :bootstrap-pencil: in each collection to:

- **Name** it and add a **description** â€” include emojis if thatâ€™s your style ðŸ˜‰

- Select a **thumbnail** to represent it: Choose between a page screenshot and a placeholder

- Choose the **initial view** for your Collection

## Download a Collection

Downloading a collection will export every archived item in it as a single WACZ file. To download a collection, use the _Download Collection_ option under the collection's _Actions_ dropdown.

## Collection Access

Collections can be set to one of the one following access modes.

- Private â€” Collections only accessible to logged in users
- Unlisted â€” Collections can be shared with others, given the link to the collection.
- Public â€” Collections can be shared with others, and when enabled, collections can also be listed in the [public collections gallery](org-settings.md#public-collections-gallery).

!!! tip "Note: About Public Collections Gallery"
    If the public collections gallery page is not enabled, any existing public collections are treated the same as unlisted collections. Check out [enabling public collection gallery](../public-collections-gallery) for a guide on how to enable this page.
