# Change Org Settings

Settings that apply to the entire organization are found in the **Settings** page. If you're an org admin, you'll see the link to _Settings_ in the org navigation bar.

## General

### Name and URL

Choose a display name for your org that's unique and memorable, like the name of your company, organization, or personal project. This name will be visible in the org's [public profile](#profile), if that page is enabled.

The org URL is where you and other org members will go to view the dashboard, configure org settings, and manage all other org-related activities. Changing this URL will also update the URL of your org's public profile, if enabled.

Org name and URLs are unique to each Browsertrix instance (for example, on `app.browsertrix.com`) and you may be prompted to change the org name or URL identifier if either are already in use by another org.

### Profile

Enable and configure a public profile page for your org. Once enabled, anyone on the internet with a link to your org's profile page will be able to view public information like the org name, description, and public collections.

## Billing

`Paid Feature`{ .badge-green }

View and manage your org's current payment plan and associated quotas. Usage history statistics for previous months are shown here to better inform your plan and quota requirements.

## Crawling Defaults

Set default suggested settings for all new crawl workflows. When creating a new workflow, org members will see the form pre-filled with these default values. Org members can still change or remove these settings when configuring the workflow. Removing a default setting will revert the setting back to Browsertrix' defaults.

<!-- ## Limits

This tab lets organization admins set an additional number of allowed overage minutes when the organization's monthly execution minutes quota has been reached. If set, this serves as a hard cap after which all running crawls will be stopped. When set at the default of 0, crawls will be stopped as soon as the monthly quota is reached. -->
