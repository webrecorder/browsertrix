# Change Org Settings

Settings that apply to the entire organization are found in the **Settings** page. If you're an org admin, you'll see the link to _Settings_ in the org navigation bar.

## General

### Name, URL, and other basic information

Your org name appears throughout the web application and in email notifications. Choose a display name for your org that's unique and memorable, like the name of your company, organization, or personal project.

The org URL is where you and other org members will go to view the dashboard, configure org settings, and manage all other org-related activities. If your org is [visible to the public](#visibility), changing this will also update the URL to your org's public page.

Org name and URLs are unique to each Browsertrix instance (for example, on `app.browsertrix.com`) and you may be prompted to change the org name or URL if either are already in use by another org.

??? info "What information will be visible to the public?"
    All org information is private until you make the org visible. Once your org is made visible to the public, the org name, description, and website will appear on the org's public page. You can preview how information appears to the public by visiting the **Public Page URL** in **Visibility** settings.

### Visibility

Make you org visible to public to share your org. Once enabled, anyone on the internet with a link to your org's public page will be able to view general information like the org name, description, website, and public collections.

## Billing

`Paid Feature`{ .badge-green }

View and manage your org's current payment plan and associated quotas. Usage history statistics for previous months are shown here to better inform your plan and quota requirements.

## Crawling Defaults

Set default suggested settings for all new crawl workflows. When creating a new workflow, org members will see the form pre-filled with these default values. Org members can still change or remove these settings when configuring the workflow. Removing a default setting will revert the setting back to Browsertrix' defaults.

<!-- ## Limits

This tab lets organization admins set an additional number of allowed overage minutes when the organization's monthly execution minutes quota has been reached. If set, this serves as a hard cap after which all running crawls will be stopped. When set at the default of 0, crawls will be stopped as soon as the monthly quota is reached. -->
