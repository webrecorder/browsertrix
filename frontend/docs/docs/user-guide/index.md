# Welcome

Browsertrix is an intuitive, automated web archiving platform designed to allow you to archive, replay, and share websites exactly as they were at a certain point in time.

Browsertrix is built and hosted by [Webrecorder](https://webrecorder.net/), a leading expert in web archiving. Our goal is to make web archiving easier and more accessible to everyone through open source tools, easy-to-use interfaces, and community building.

This user guide documents features, terminology, and settings in the Browsertrix web interface. The user guide navigation is organized similarly to the Browsertrix web interface for ease of browsing. You can also use the search box up top to search by topic.

If you have any feedback on our documentation [we'd love to hear it](mailto:docs-feedback@webrecorder.net). We've written the user guide with both seasoned web archivists and new archivists in mind and we value feedback from all levels of archiving experience.

Thanks for choosing Browsertrix! Ready for [your first crawl](./getting-started.md)?
