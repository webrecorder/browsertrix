Components here should be reusable across Browsertrix Cloud (and perhaps eventually across other Webrecorder projects as well). They should generally not depend on auth, not be specific to a single page or view, and have well-defined (and typed) inputs and outputs.

<!-- TODO some sort of list of what's in here â€” storybook maybe? -->
