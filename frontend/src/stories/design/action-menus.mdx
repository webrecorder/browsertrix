# Action Menus

While controls are always placed next to the most relevant content area, we
expose most controls for an object in an _Actions_ dropdown menu to enable
discovery of actions in a single place, and allow power-users to quickly
accomplish tasks.

We try to avoid surfacing navigation options in action menus as they are not
tagged as navigation elements. Sometimes we expose links here for convenience,
but navigating to another page should never only be possible through an actions
menu.

## Implementation

Action menus should generally contain a consistent set of actions for a given
object. Whereas new table rows symbolize horizontal separators, these actions
should be ordered as follows:

| Dropdown Action Order                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Actions related only to the current page (eg: remove archived item from collection)                                                                   |
| Actions related to editing the object (eg: edit workflow config, edit item metadata)<br/> Other actions related to the current object (eg: run crawl) |
| Actions related to exporting/downloading (eg: download archived item)                                                                                 |
| Copy information to clipboard (eg: copy share link)<br/> Copy IDs to clipboard (eg: copy item ID)                                                     |
| Destructive actions (eg: delete item)                                                                                                                 |
