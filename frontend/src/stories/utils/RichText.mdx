<Title />

This is a rich text renderer that converts links in plain text into real links,
in a similar way to the way social media posts often do. Links always open in a
new tab, and the link detection is generally pretty forgiving.

This should generally be used when displaying descriptions or other
medium-length user-generated plain text, e.g. org or workflow descriptions.

For longer text, consider using a more complete markdown setup, e.g. a
Collection’s “About” section.
