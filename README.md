Browsertrix Cloud is an open-source cloud-native high-fidelity browser-based crawling service designed
to make web archiving easier and more accessible for everyone.

The service provides an API and UI for scheduling crawls and viewing results,
and managing all aspects of crawling process. This system provides the orchestration and management around crawling,
while the actual crawling is performed using
[Browsertrix Crawler](https://github.com/webrecorder/browsertrix-crawler) containers, which are launched for each crawl.

The system is designed to run in both Kubernetes and Docker Swarm, as well as locally under Podman.

See [Features](https://browsertrix.cloud/features) for a high-level list of planned features.
